- I have developed the pseudo frontend app Recipe-Sore with Payment Gateway using pure React only. 
- I could have used redux in this app but considering the less complexity of this app, I chose not to use redux. 
- If you want to run this app on your system, you just need to be on the directory recipe-payment-gateway and run the command 'npm install' and after that run 'npm start' and this will launch the app on your localhost server. Now you can see this app running in your browser.

- I have tried to keep the User Interface as clean and simple as possible. I have also added slight animation when user hovers over a Recipe card for making the app look attractive. 
- On Payment Page when user starts typing card details, he will immediately get to see the card details on a demo card picture. This will make filling-in the card details more comfortable and interactive for users.
- Correct OTP is '123456'.
